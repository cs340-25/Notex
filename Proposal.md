#### Introduction:
We are planning on creating a feature rich note taking app that supports LaTeX, drawing, and other forms of note taking. 

We are first going to get a basic skeleton of the app that allows for basic navigation and functionality. This is so that everyone has a foundation to work on and to prevent conflicts at the root. We have created a Google document with all of the features and ranked each one based on importance. Everyone is pretty much going to be a feature engineer and will be implement features based on the rankings. This way, should we run into issues with a feature, it won't slow the whole development process.
