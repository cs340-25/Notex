### Title: Nuzz
#### Team Members: Ashton Dy, Perry Shu, Porter Dosch, Colsen Murray, Adam Abdelrahman

#### Proposal:
We are planning on creating a feature rich note taking app that supports LaTeX, drawing, and other forms of note taking. 

We are first going to get a basic skeleton of the app taht allows for basic navigation and functionality. After that, everyone is pretty much a feature engineer and will be implement features based on the rankings that we gave.
